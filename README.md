# 👋 Hi, I'm Kenny 

### **Building Interactive Tools for Frontier Technologies**  

I'm a developer exploring the intersection of **graphics programming**, **emerging technologies**, and **interactive user interfaces**. My work focuses on bringing complex systems—whether quantum computing or AI data visualizations—into intuitive, visual, and engaging tools.

---

### **🛠️ What I Do**
- **WebGPU Visualizations**: High-performance rendering of large datasets and 3D graphics.  
- **Quantum Visualizers**: Conceptualizing tools that bring quantum states to life.  
- **Cutting-Edge Tech**: Leveraging next-gen tools like WebGPU to explore spatial data and AI.

### **🌟 Featured Projects**

🚀 **[WebGPU Topographic Map](https://github.com/your-repo-link)**  
*A 2D/3D elevation renderer that processes and visualizes TIFF data in real time.*  
- Built with **Vite** + **WebGPU**.  
- Interactive controls for exploring terrain.  
- Designed for speed and scalability.

 **[Quantum Bloch Sphere Visualizer] **  🚧 In Development
*A WebGPU-powered Bloch Sphere visualizer styled as a disco ball, showcasing quantum gate transformations.*  
- Conceptualized to teach and explore quantum states interactively.  
- Combines creativity and technical precision.  

🧠 **[Deepscatter WebGPU Prototype](https://github.com/your-repo-link)**  
*WebGPU implementation for visualizing deep embeddings (forked and modernized for Nomic AI).*  
- Demonstrates handling of massive datasets.  
- Pushes performance boundaries beyond WebGL.
